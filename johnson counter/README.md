# Johnson Counter
A Johnson counter is a digital circuit with a series of flip flops connected in a feedback manner.
Johnson counter is a counter that counts 2N states if the number of bits is N.
Therefore, the advantage is by using N number of flip flops we can count upto 2N states.
Minimisation of hardware is done.
The circuit is a special type of shift register where the last flip flop's complement output is fed back to the first flip flop's input. 
It is also known as twisted ring counter.
